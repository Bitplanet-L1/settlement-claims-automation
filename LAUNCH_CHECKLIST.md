Subject: Built an AI agent that made $472 in 52 minutes

Hey [Name],

I built an AI agent that:
1. Identified settlement claims as a revenue opportunity
2. Built automation to discover + auto-file claims
3. Tested it in production ($472 in 52 minutes)
4. Open-sourced the entire thing

Thought your audience might find this interesting - it's a case study in AI-driven product development + passive income automation.

Best,
[Your name]
