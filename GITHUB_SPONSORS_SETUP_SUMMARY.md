## 💡 Value Proposition

**For users:**
> "This tool made me $472 in 52 minutes. For $5/mo, you ensure it keeps working and gets better."

**ROI Framing:**
> "If this tool files ONE claim worth $50, it pays for a year of sponsorship. You'll likely file 10-20 claims/year."

**Scarcity:**
> "Goal: 10-20 sponsors. Early sponsors get priority for feature requests."
