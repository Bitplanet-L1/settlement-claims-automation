**Title:** I built a tool that made me $472/hour filing settlement claims - now accepting sponsors

**Body:**

Hey r/PassiveIncome,

Last week I shared my settlement claims automation tool and the response was amazing. Many of you successfully filed claims and are waiting on payouts.

**Quick recap:**
- Automates discovery & form-filling for class action settlements
- I filed 5 claims in 52 minutes → $472 estimated payout
- Open source, free to use

**What's new:**

I've launched [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/sidinflorencers9903) to keep this project maintained and add features you've requested:

- OCR for receipt extraction
- Mobile app
- More settlement sources (JND, Angeion, Kroll)
- Custom alerts for specific settlement types

**Sponsor tiers:**

🌱 **$5/mo** - Keep scrapers running  
🚀 **$10/mo** - Priority features + monthly summaries  
💎 **$25/mo** - 1-on-1 setup + custom alerts

**Why sponsor?**

Settlement websites change their layouts frequently. Without ongoing maintenance, the scrapers break. Your sponsorship ensures:

- Weekly scraper updates
- New features based on community feedback
- Long-term reliability

If this tool made you money (or will make you money), consider chipping in a few bucks/month to keep it alive.

**Repo:** https://github.com/Bitplanet-L1/settlement-claims-automation  
**Sponsor:** https://github.com/sponsors/sidinflorencers9903

Goal: 10-20 sponsors to sustain development. Let's make passive income accessible to everyone!
